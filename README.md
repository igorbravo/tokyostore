# tokyostore


This is was my first project that i made in my first time, containing only HTML and CSS, although i refactored the entire code, using javascript too

At the beginning of the project the idea of this website consisted in a clothing store. But today i realize that the store looked more like a model agency 

My actual idea nowadays is study more to get this website better and more prettier using Angular
